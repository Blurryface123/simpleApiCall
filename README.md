# simpleApiCall

### Technologies: 
- Python 3.7
- Flask

### Description:
This is a simple project to test one endpoint that it's supposed to receive one a list as a parameter and return the sum of the numbers.
As for now the list is hardcoded to test the enpoint functionality.

### Enpoint:
The path to test the enpoint is "/total". Nevertheless, if you don't write any path it should automatically redirect you to "/total".

### How to run it:
Just clone the repository and start playing with it. Once you run the app, go to localhost:5000/total. The endpoint should automatically give you the sum of a hardcoded list.
